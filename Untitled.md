## What is Mantle?

#### Mantl [[https://www.mantl.com]] , is a financial services startup that seeks to help your local banks and credit unions grow deposits and stream line back office tasks.  Founded by Benjamin Conant , Nathaniel Harley and Raj Patel in 2016.  Mantl, with its headquarters in New York, NY ,  has helped banks and credit unions raise more than ** 1 Billion dollars** in core deposits. Their customers grew deposits at a 78% faster rate than they did before switching

#### Now Mantl isnt in this space alone, they do have competition. Businesses such as KAL[[https://www.kal.com/en/]] , Leveris[[www.crunchbase.com/organization/leveris]] and Home Credit[[https://www.homecreditus.com]]. Unlike these other companies though, Mantl has the ** HIGHEST** performing account opening solution anywhere in the market. As seen by its performance. 

#### In July of 2020 Mantl raised 19 million dollars after growing its deposits volume an astonishing **705%** in April of 2020.  In fact,  Mantl rasied its over all revenue "2x" in 2020 as banks and credit unions rushed to meet the increased demand for digital offerings for consumers in the aftermath of COVID-19. Though , from all the research I have done, the startup  **does not**  give hard revenue figures.  But, in their latest seris B funding , they raised 40 million dollars to bring their total amount of funding raised since inception to 60.7 million dollars. This new funding will help them expand operations and hire the talent needed to continue its growth.

#### While Mantl is surely performing above the competition , there is one place I have seen a need that perhaps Mantl can/will try and help fix. Since we are talking about banks and credit unions of smaller scale one can assume we are talking a rural community or a smaller town. And the 1 thing that almost every small town or rural community has?  **Transiant workers** who are overwhelmingly underbanked  or even **unbanked*. This leaves a big share of people that rural credit unions and banks could tap into for for potential service., wether that be through remintances or some other potential services. The potential for growth is already established and I would highly recommend this company  for purchase of shares where ever to be made available or if you wanted to grow your bank or credit union.
